**Who Created [Adken Anti-Aging Serum](https://www.hoggit.com/adkenantiagingserum60ml) ?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cameron Walker, a man of 47 years old, developed Adken Anti-Aging Serum. Cameron worked for the past decade as a professor of chemistry at one of America's top universities. Cameron doesn't reveal the name of his university to protect his privacy. Cameron's former students are now working on some of the most important chemistry inventions of our time, such as treatments for psoriasis and other skin conditions.

Cameron is a good worker, but his love for his wife, Lyanna, is greater. Lyanna has always taken good care of her over the years. Lyanna noticed dark spots on her skin a few years back. She used serums and face masks as well as creams and gels. She used concealer and foundation. It seemed that nothing worked. Lyanna eventually developed a morning and night routine of 15 steps to help treat dark spots, moles, and freckles. Cameron was determined to assist Lyanna and began researching natural treatments for dark spots. Adken Anti-Aging Serum was the result of his research.

**How Does [Adken Anti-Aging Serum](https://www.prlog.org/12963383-adken-anti-aging-serum-give-you-skin-what-it-need-not-what-world-say.html) Work?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adken Anti-Aging Serum uses a Taiwanese skincare serum. The formula was created using tea extracts and a combination of natural antioxidants. Vitamin C is also included. You can supposedly remove "decades" of age from your face by applying serum nightly to the face after cleaning. This formula claims it can also eliminate dark spots and wrinkles from the roots, hydrate and nourish the skin and remove wrinkles.

Adken Anti-Aging Serum was developed by the makers to specifically combat the cause of dark marks: an odd light phenomenon that occurs around 2 pm every day. Your skin is constantly exposed at 2 pm to an irritant that causes dark spots. Others develop dark spots due to the trigger. Applying Adken Anti-Aging Serum ly nightly will protect your skin from aging effects while also naturally removing dark spots.

**Hyaluronic acid**

The hyaluronic component can hold 1,000 times more moisture than its weight, allowing your skin to maintain moisture. This helps with skin repair while making you appear younger. This component softens skin and eliminates peeling and dryness.

**Graveolens**

Adken Anti-Aging Serum contains graveolens, a key ingredient that deeply penetrates your epidermis and repairs the skin. Graveolens are rich in flavonoids, phenolic acid, and natural steroids, which support the skin's health and help prevent aging.

**Aloe Barbadensis**

Aloe Barbadensis, also known as Aloe Vera Extract. It is used widely in cosmetics and beauty products due to its many benefits. Aloe vera is moisturizing, and hydrating, and has a soothing effect on the skin. Recent studies have shown that the ingredient can heal wounds and fight skin damage. It also has anti-aging properties.

**Sencha**

Green tea or sencha extracts are rich in catechins (antioxidants) that reduce inflammation. This is especially true around the skin. This skin-rejuvenating product helps to improve elasticity.

**Witch Hazel & Horsetail**

The tannins in witch hazel create a protective barrier that shields the skin against modern blue light. Horsetail unclogs your skin and prevents oxidation.

**Jojoba Oil**

Natural moisturizers like jojoba prevent the skin from cracking and drying. The fantastic moisturizer, according to research, has anti-inflammatory properties and creates a barrier on the skin when used topically. Iodine in jojoba oil is antibacterial, which prevents bacteria from growing and causing skin breakouts.

**Gotukola**

Ayurvedic Gotu Kola can be found in the Himalayan Mountains. Gotu Kola, according to research, can help prevent infection by improving the body's resistance to external damage. Adken Anti-Aging Serum 's markers claim to improve your skin barrier by preventing external toxins. Gotu kola contains antioxidants that protect the skin against external damage.

**Sage**

Sage has been used for centuries in aromatherapy and traditional medicine. It is an antioxidant that helps improve the appearance of your skin.

**Vitamin C**

Vitamin C, an antioxidant, promotes the growth of tissue and its repair. The serum helps to seal and strengthen the skin by retaining moisture. Adken Anti-Aging Serum contains ascorbic, a Vitamin C form that increases collagen and glucoside production. The ascorbic acid breaks down to pure Vitamin C, which strengthens the immune system, prevents diseases and infections, and boosts immunity.

**Vitamin E**

The antioxidant properties of vitamins C and E are beneficial to your health. Most vitamins are found in plants, fruits, herbs, and vegetables. Vitamins support the healthy inflammation response of the body. The vitamin helps keep skin smooth and firm, preventing oxidation. Vitamin E reduces redness and supports collagen synthesis.

**Hops**

Adken Anti-Aging Serum Comple helps to eliminate oxidation by using a specific type of hops. Natural antioxidants strengthen your immune system and help prevent inflammation.

**Rosemary Oil**

The rosemary's antifungal, antibacterial, and aromatic properties make it an important herb. Oil helps to brighten skin, moisturize, and reduce fine lines. By expanding blood vessels, rosemary oil increases blood flow in the toes and fingers. It prevents your skin from showing signs of aging and acts as a shield between you and the modern blue light.

**Lemon Peel Extraction**

The lemon peel extract is rich in Vitamin C and is a powerful antioxidant to protect your skin from oxidation. The body benefits from the minerals in it, such as calcium and magnesium. The citric acid in lemon peel reduces hyperpigmentation.

**Scots Pine**

Scots Pine prevents aging by tightening and removing fine wrinkles. This gives you long-term anti-aging results.
